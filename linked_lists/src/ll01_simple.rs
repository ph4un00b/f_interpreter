     * We heap-allocate an extra node, but one of our nodes doesn't
     * need to be heap-allocated at all.
     * However, consider the following potential layout for our list:
     *
     * ‚ùó [ptr] -> (Elem A, ptr) -> (Elem B, *null*)

     * In this layout we now unconditionally heap allocate our nodes.
     * The key difference is the absence of the junk from our first layout.

//? The big takeaway here is that even though Nil is a single bit of information,
//? it necessarily consumes enough space for a pointer and an element,
//? because it has to be ready to become an Elem at any time.
//? Therefore the first layout heap allocates an extra element that's
//? just full of junk, consuming a bit more space than the second layout.
/*
* One of our nodes not being allocated at all is also, perhaps surprisingly,
* worse than always allocating it.
* This is because it gives us a non-uniform node layout.‚ùó
* This doesn't have much of an appreciable effect on pushing and popping nodes,
* but it does have an effect on splitting and merging lists üëÄ.
*
* layout 1:
*
* [Elem A, ptr] -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Elem C, ptr) -> (Nil *junk*)
* split off C:
*
* [Elem A, ptr] -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Nil *junk*)
* [Elem C, ptr] -> (Nil *junk*)
*
* layout 2:
*
* [ptr] -> (Elem A, ptr) -> (Elem B, ptr) -> (Elem C, *null*)
* split off C:
*
* [ptr] -> (Elem A, ptr) -> (Elem B, *null*)
* [ptr] -> (Elem C, *null*)
*/
//? Layout 2's split involves just copying B's pointer to
//? the stack and nulling the old value out.
//? Layout 1 ultimately does the same thing,
//? but also has to copy C from the heap to the stack.
//? Merging is the same process in reverse.
/*
 * One of the few nice things about a linked list is that you can construct
 * the element in the node itself, and then freely shuffle it around
 * lists without ever moving it.
 * You just fiddle with pointers and stuff gets "moved".
 * Layout 1 trashes this property.‚ùó
